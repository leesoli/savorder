      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p className="">Makisoba started in 1965 by a young couple who loved to cook and serve others. Julia and Peter, whom are now retired, have passed down their recipe and family-owned business to their children, Janette and Lowry.
      </p>
      <p className="">Since our establishment in 1965, the store motto has always been <strong>cook freshly once ordered</strong>. Our philosophy is to be a store that is loved by all, immersed in hospitality</p>
